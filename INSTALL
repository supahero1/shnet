                           Building & installing shnet
================================================================================

TL;DR
To build and install the library, do:

    make install

Consider adding 'test' at the end of the command to make sure the library works
as expected.

-------------------------------- DETAILED GUIDE --------------------------------

Since shnet is only meant to be run on Linux, there is no configuration
executable. You can build the library right away with:

    make

or

    make build

You must execute 'make' in the top dir of the source code (that this file is in)
or the compilation will fail.

If you wish to build the library with debug info, add:

    make DEBUG=1

The library can also be built as static or shared, where the latter is the
default. Build a static one with:

    make STATIC=1

If you built a static release, you must also add 'STATIC=1' to the installation
command mentioned below.

After building, tests can be run with:

    make test

You can also run every test with Valgrind (recommended to also build with debug
then):

    make test VALGRIND=1

Tests can also be run to test line coverage of the library. To do that, add
'COVERAGE=1' to both 'build' and 'test':

    make COVERAGE=1
    make test COVERAGE=1

Or, simply:

    make test COVERAGE=1

Since this will also (re)build the library before testing. In fact, any flags
that you pass to 'make', like 'DEBUG' or 'COVERAGE', will also be passed to any
other steps in the process.

If you are a developer trying to create new tests or edit current ones, the
above command alone will always rebuild all tests, which might be annoying.
To only rebuild modified tests, do:

    make test PRESERVE_TESTS=1

Some tests have certain timing requirements to be met. If you see some failed
assertions, try rerunning the tests under lower system load.

Next, the library is ready to be installed (to '/usr/local' by default) with:

    make install

You can change the output dir for headers and library files with 'DIR_LIB' and
'DIR_INCLUDE' variables. See the beginning of 'Makefile' file in the top dir for
more info and variables to change.

If the library was not built beforehand, the command will do it. It will not
test the library. Any flags will be passed down to both 'build' and 'install'.

You may remove your installation with:

    make uninstall

The above will only remove the library and header files from the file system.

You may also remove all intermediate files created by any make commands with:

    make clean

All of the above targets will output only the necessary information without any
build info. If you wish to see more of what is going on behind the curtains,
add:

    make <command> VERBOSE=1

Additionally, you may chain multiple commands, as long as the commands are
linear (i.e. you don't mix building with cleaning up files):

    make clean uninstall install test DEBUG=1 VERBOSE=1

The above will first remove any files created by previous make commands,
then remove the library and its headers from system directories, followed by
building, installing and testing the library with debug info, all of that with
verbose output.

It is impossible to use the same commands more than once in one call to 'make'.
