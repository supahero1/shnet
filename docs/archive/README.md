Modules from previous releases of the library that are no longer used have
been put in the `src/archive` folder, and their tests (if any) are in the
`tests/archive` directory. Their documentation might be incomplete and in
older formats than documentation in the `docs/c` directory. Full integrity
of the code is not guaranteed - it might have memory leaks, it might not
work at all. Thus, the usage of the outdated modules is disencouraged.
