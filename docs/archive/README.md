Modules from previous releases of the library that are no longer used have been put in the `src_archive` folder, and their tests (if any) are in the `test_archive` directory. Their documentation might be incomplete and in older formats than documentation in the `docs/c` directory. Full integrity of the code is not guaranteed - it might have memory leaks or other issues. Thus, the usage of the outdated modules is disencouraged.
